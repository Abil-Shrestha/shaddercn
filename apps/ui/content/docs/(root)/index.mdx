Shaddercn is an **agent-native design system built for coding agents**. It is being built on top of coss UI and is **not** meant for manual use by humans.

That means there are **no installation steps**, no "copy/paste this into your app", and no "how to use" guides.

## Inspiration

Shaddercn is inspired by:

- shadcn
- tremor
- Radix UI
- Base UI
- coss UI
