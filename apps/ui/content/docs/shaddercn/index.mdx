description: An agent-native design system built for coding agents.
---

Shaddercn is an **agent-native design system built for coding agents**. It is **not** meant for manual use by humans.

That means there are **no installation steps**, no “copy/paste this into your app”, and no “how to use” guides.

Instead, the interface is a **single registry fetch** that an agent can consume.

## Agent registry

Fetch the current Shaddercn registry:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/ui/shaddercn/registry
```

## Inspiration

Shaddercn is inspired by:

- shadcn
- tremor
- Radix UI
- Base UI
- shaddercn (previously Origin UI)

## Components

- [Button](/docs/shaddercn/button)
- [Card](/docs/shaddercn/card)
